# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
Ans: around 1 week
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Ans: Ability to export event and todo items to .ics files.
      I searched a lot. And skimmed through RFC 5545.
      Learnt that iCalendar format is not related to apple :).
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
Ans:
    a) Feature 1 Allow deletion of multiple items : in suggestions
    b) Feature 2 Change the priority levels of items : in suggestions
    c) Feature 3 Ability to add recurrence to event and todo items : really wanted to export event and todo items to icalendar files
    d) Feature 4 Ability to export event and todo items to .ics files : really wanted to export event and todo items to icalendar files
    e) Feature 5 To select item_at_index from UdaciList object : necessary feature
    f) Feature 6 To fetch title for UdaciList link item when title is absent : wanted to add Pockets like functionality
    g) Feature 7 Print UdaciList in nice tabular format : was resistant to it initially but when I saw the example in github page, went ahead with it.
    h) Feature 8 Avoid name collision for Untitled Lists : Most application do it, wanted to see how I can implement it
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
Ans: I need to read a little more about modules.
      I looked at code https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube and didn't get why they have declared module IceCube multiple
      times. https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube/tree/master/lib/ice_cube/parsers here every ruby file contains IceCube module
      again and again.
